Unwarranted Credits:

Harry-T: You, as a mathematician, produced this table. You deserve nothing but praise for your genuis. But you did not know the rule-of-law when you decided to DMCA people for something you chose to make public domain.

Metaphira: You perfected Harry's code. As you should have given your knowledge. But you repeated Harry's mistakes. Thanks for at least being willing to release this version (V3) publicly with Toasters.

Toaster: Speaking of whom. You have our thanks, but I still have yet to be given a good reason why you pulled the github. Until then, you are nothing but repeating, a third time, the mistakes of evil people.
